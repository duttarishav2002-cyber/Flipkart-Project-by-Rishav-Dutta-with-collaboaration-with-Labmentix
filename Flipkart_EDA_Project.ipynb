Initially, columns with excessive missing values (more than 20% missing data) were dropped to focus only on useful variables, which resulted in the removal of columns like connected_handling_time and Customer_City. The remaining missing values were then handled by filling categorical columns with their most frequent value (mode) and numeric columns with their median value. Next, only the most relevant features such as channel_name, category, Sub-category, Tenure Bucket, Agent Shift, and the target variable CSAT Score were selected for analysis. Categorical variables were encoded using one-hot encoding to prepare them for machine learning models. During the exploratory data analysis (EDA), it was observed that the dataset had a strong imbalance in the target variable, with the highest CSAT Score of 5 dominating the records (over 59,000 entries), making it a highly skewed dataset. Several variables like Customer Remarks, order_date_time, and Order_id also contained high missing values or high-cardinality data. Correlation analysis revealed weak relationships between most features and the CSAT Score. Despite this, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost classifiers were applied to predict the CSAT Score. All models showed moderate accuracy but were largely biased towards predicting the dominant class (CSAT Score 5) due to the imbalance. Overall, this project highlighted key challenges such as missing data, imbalanced target variables, and limited predictive power, while providing meaningful insights into customer satisfaction trends and agent performance characteristics within the dataset."],"metadata":{"id":"LbyXE7I1olp8"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## ***4.

Optimize Agent Performance and Scheduling\n","[cite_start]The feature importance analysis identified **Agent Tenure Bucket** and **Agent Shift** as significant factors influencing CSAT scores[cite: 1].\n","\n","* **Targeted Training:** Design special training or mentorship programs for agents in low-performing **Tenure Buckets** (likely new hires or those in the initial 0-30/31-60 day periods) to quickly bring them up to standard performance.\n","* **Shift Optimization:** Analyze which **Agent Shifts** (Morning, Evening, Night, Split) are associated with lower CSAT scores and investigate if this is due to lower staffing levels, less experienced supervisors, or heavier case loads during those times. Adjust shift staffing or supervision accordingly.\n","\n","### 2. Streamline Problem Categories and Channels\n","[cite_start]The analysis highlights that **channel name** and specific **Sub-category types** significantly influence CSAT[cite: 1].\n","\n","* [cite_start]**Process Improvement for \"High-Friction\" Issues:** Identify the **Sub-categories** that correlate most strongly with **low CSAT scores** (e.g., \"Delayed,\" \"Seller Cancelled Order,\" \"Fraudulent User\") and dedicate specialist teams or create automated solutions (GenAI) to resolve these faster[cite: 1].\n","* [cite_start]**Channel Efficiency:** Analyze if certain interaction channels (e.g., Inbound, Outcall, Email) are bottlenecks or lead to lower satisfaction[cite: 1]. For example, if \"Inbound\" calls yield low CSAT, invest in better IVR filtering or quicker routing to the right agent.\n","\n","### 3. Focus on Speed of Service\n","[cite_start]The introduction of the **response time in minutes** as a feature confirms that speed is a measurable factor[cite: 1].\n","\n","* **Set SLAs (Service Level Agreements):** Implement stricter internal targets for `Time_to_Respond` and `connected_handling_time` for all agents, focusing especially on those issue categories that lead to low CSAT.\n","* [cite_start]**System Integration:** Use the predictive model to enable continuous performance monitoring and immediate flagging of customer interactions that are exceeding average handling time or are predicted to result in low CSAT scores, allowing for a supervisor to intervene proactively[cite: 1].\n","\n","[cite_start]These actions directly utilize the insights derived from the machine learning model to enhance service experience and meet your stated business objective[cite: 1].\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"pASKb0qOza21"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Conclusion**"],"metadata":{"id":"gCX9965dhzqZ"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This project successfully achieved its core objective: developing a **reliable machine learning model to predict Flipkart's Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores** based on historical customer support data. The accurate and proactive prediction of CSAT is crucial for sustaining growth, strengthening customer loyalty, and optimizing support operations.\n","\n","### Key Findings and Deliverables\n","The implemented workflow, which included detailed data preprocessing, calculated a new **response time in minutes** feature, utilized **one-hot encoding** for categorical variables, applied **StandardScaler** for numeric features, and leveraged **SMOTE** to address class imbalance, resulted in a robust final model. Of the several classifiers tested (Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Random Forest), the **Random Forest Classifier demonstrated the best overall performance** across accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n","\n","The subsequent **Feature Importance analysis** delivered critical business intelligence, confirming that key drivers of customer satisfaction include the **channel name** used by the customer, the **Tenure Bucket** and **Agent Shift** of the handling executive, and specific **Sub-category types** of the issue.\n","\n","### Actionable Strategic Recommendations\n","The findings translate directly into actionable strategies for enhancing service quality:\n","1.  **Targeted Training:** Developing specialized training programs focusing on improving performance for agents identified in low-performing Tenure Buckets.\n","2.  **Operational Optimization:** Adjusting staffing and supervision for specific **Agent Shifts** or high-volume/high-friction **Sub-categories** to minimize bottlenecks and service degradation.\n","3.  **Proactive Intervention:** Integrating the predictive model into real-time systems to flag interactions likely to result in low CSAT, enabling managers to intervene proactively and salvage the customer experience.\n","\n","In essence, this project delivers both a powerful **predictive tool** and a clear, **data-driven roadmap** for Flipkart to make meaningful, systemic improvements to its customer service, leading directly to increased brand loyalty and customer retention."],"metadata":{"id":"Fjb1IsQkh3yE"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### ***Hurrah!
